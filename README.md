# Sentiment-Analysis-with-Task-Vectors
Final homework of "Neural Networks for Data Science Applications"

In this project, we explore an innovative approach to fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model for sentiment analysis by leveraging the task vectors technique. This methodology, inspired by the recent advancements presented in the paper "Editing Models with Task Vectors," aims to enhance the model's performance and adaptability for specific tasks.
